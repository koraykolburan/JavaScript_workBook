               <h2>Objects</h2>
               <p>Complexity is based on simplicity which is objects.</p>
               <p>Your program can only contain <strong>Nouns,</strong> <strong>Adjectives</strong> and  <strong>Verbs.</strong></p>
               <ul>
                    <li><b>Nouns</b> are descriptive.(-properties)</li>
                    <li><b>Adjectives</b> are descriptive.</li>
                    <li><b>Verbs</b> are descriptive.</li>
               </ul>
               <hr>
               <h3>Nouns</h3>
               <p>
                    - We have the <b>nouns</b>such as the width, height, color and weight. <br>
                    <h4>Properties</h4>
                    <code>
                         { <br>
                              &nbsp;    width: 25, <br>
                              &nbsp;    height: 27, <br>
                              &nbsp;    color: red, <br>
                              &nbsp;    weight:5, <br>
                              &nbsp;    eat: function(){ "Eat the apple."; }, <br>
                              &nbsp;    throw: function(){ "Throw the apple away."; }, <br>
                              &nbsp;    } 
                         <br>
                    </code> <br>
                    ! These are <b>nouns,</b> but they are <u>not good enough</u> to describe the entire object. 
               </p>
               <hr>
               <h3>Adjectives</h3>
               <p>
                    That's why we also need the <b>adjectives</b> as well. <br> 
                    Such as the string: <i>red.</i> <br>
               </p>
               <hr>
               <h3>Verbs</h3>
               <p>
                    Next, we need <strong>verbs</strong> all performing action which is a <strong>function</strong>. <br> 
                    <code>
                         &nbsp;    eat: function(){ "Eat the apple."; }, <br>
                         &nbsp;    throw: function(){ "Throw the apple away."; }, <br>
                    </code> <br>

               </p>
               <hr>
               <h3>Method</h3>
               <p>
                    - When a function is <u>within</u> an object it's still function. <br>
                    But we give it a different name: we call it a <b>Method.</b> <br>
                    <code>
                         { <br>
                              &nbsp;    width: 25, <br>
                              &nbsp;    height: 27, <br>
                              &nbsp;    color: red, <br>
                              &nbsp;    weight:5, <br>
                              <span id="separate">eat: function(){ "Eat the apple."; },</span> <br>
                              <span id="separate">throw: function(){ "Throw the apple away."; },</span> <br>
               &nbsp;    } 
                         <br>
                    </code> <br>
                    When we say a method, it simply means a function that is contained within an object.
                    <hr>
                    <b>Objects</b> are so important because they allow you to group information together that relate to certain aspects of your program. { ... }  
               </p>
               <hr>
               <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
               <h4>Example:</h4>
               <p>
                    Take at your computer, take a look <br> 
                    <span id="code-block">{ the width, the height, the color, the KeyboardSize, the trackPadType }</span> so on and so forth.. <br>
                    And then, look at what you can do with the computer(functions-verbs). <br>
                    <span id="code-block">
                         { <br>
                              typeText: function(){ ... }, <br>
                              watchVideos: function(){ ... }, <br>
                         } <br>
                    </span>
               </p>
               <hr>
               <h3>Embedded Objects</h3>
               <h4>Example:</h4>
               <p>
                    Objects do contain objects. <br>
                    For example: your PC has camera, a screen, a keyboard, a trackpad.. <br>
                    Each of which their own nouns and verbs associated with each component in your PC. <br>
                    Objects nests hierarchially. For instance: The sub objects and The main parent objects. <br>
                    <span id="code-block">{ the width, the height, the color, the KeyboardSize, the trackPadType, typeText: function(){ ... }, watchVideos: function(){ ... }, keyboard: { language: "en-US", functional: true}, }</span>

                    <h3>API - Application Programming Interface</h3>
                    <p>
                         An API is simply a collection of functions and also properties as well. <br>
                         There is a <b>Window {}</b> object in JavaScript that has many functions which are <b>Methods.</b> <br>
                         These were set up by Just In Time JavaScript Compiler. <br>
                    </p>
               </section>
               <section>
                    <h4>API's inside of API's</h4> 
                    <p>
                         for example: <b>jQuery.</b> <br>
                         jQuery attaches on to the Window object, that's why jQuery is an API. <br>
                         It has its own collection of functions and properties. <br>
                         That means jQuery needs the JavaScript API to define its own API. <br>
                         So jQuery is using those native API that come with JavaScript. <br>
                         The Native predefined functions and then its using those its own functions and creating its own style. <br>
                         You can call it an <b>Embedded API</b> that's what <b>libraries</b> are.

                    <h3>JavaScript String</h3>
                         <p>
                              Strings are for storing text and they are written with quotes. <br>
                              <span id="code-block">
                                   let carName1 = "BMW X1"; <br>
                         &nbsp;    let carName2 = 'WV Tiguan';
                              </span> <br>
                              ! If there are no <span id="separate">QUOTATION MARKS,</span> these are not a <span id="separate">STRING.</span>
                         </p>
                    <h4>Template Strings</h4>
                         <p>
                              With back-ticks, you can use both single and double quotes inside a string like: <br>
                              <span id="code-block">
                                   let text = `That's the "real" answer for everything in life!`;
                              </span>
                         </p>
                         <hr>
                    <h4>Two Types of Numbers</h4>
                    <p>
                         <b>Integers:</b> 100, 200, 1, 2... <br>
                         <b>Floating Point Numbers:</b> 100.256, 1.1...
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Boolean</h4>
                    <p>
                         If something is not Boolean it sinks. <br>
                         Floating or sinking.. <br>
                         Negative or positive.. <br>
                         True or False..  <br>
                         It is like light switch.. On / Off <br>
                         Yes or No.. <br>
                         - When you have just the word <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> without the quoation marks, you are defining a Boolean. <br>
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Null & Undefined</h4>
                    <p>
                         <b>Null</b> = EMPTY. It does not have anything. <br>
                         <b>Undefined</b> = EMPTY. It does not have anything. <br>
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>NaN</h4>
                    <p>
                         NaN = Not A Number. <br>
                         - If you wanted to check to see if a variable or a part of program has a number stored within it and that say <b>NaN:</b> Not A Number. <br>
                         Thus, you know not to use this variable all this value in Mathematical Expression for example.

                         It's a memory address. <br>
                         "=" equal sign is the assignment operator. <br>
                         let name = "John"; <br> 
                         <br>
                         Also we can create a box waiting for a value to be STORED. <br>

                    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
                    <p>
                         When we write on the console this: <span id="code-block">"John " + 12;</span> <br>
                         The output is gonna be like this: <span id="code-block">"John 12"</span>. <br>
                         Becase it's like playdough. It changes and adapts itself into different shapes that you push it into. <br>
                         It just changes and adapts to the environment that you throw at it. <br>
                         If there is a Boolean on the one side like: <span id="separate">true + "John"</span> <br>
                         It will convert the Boolean type into a string data type and combine them like: <span id="separate"> "trueJohn"</span>. <br>
                         <span id="code-block"> 
                              let name = "John "; <br>
                              &nbsp; name += "Johnny"; <br>
                              &nbsp; "Johny Johnny" <br>
                         </span>
                         It will convert the Null and Undefined into a string too like:
                         <span id="code-block">
                              null + "John"; <br>
                              "nullJohn" <br>
                              undefined + "John"; <br>
                              "undefinedJohn" <br>
                         </span>
                         It always convert it into a string. It changes to suit its environment.
